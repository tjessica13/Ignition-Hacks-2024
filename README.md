Submitted to Ignition Hacks Online Hackathon on August 18, 2024.

Disclaimer: For the purposes of creating this prototype, we used AI generated images for the background image and character image. We do not take credit for the image and acknowledge that artists should be credited for their art. We are only using AI generated art as a placeholder and for prototyping purposes. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
